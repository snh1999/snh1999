I have been someone who just knew about the starting line and looked at the ending goal for most of my life. 
Which worked really well as long as there was result shining, which quantifies towards until middle of 2018 in terms of time. 
Suddenly I do not have the shiny thing at the end of my efforts for things that were way out of my control, nor I knew how to enjoy the "journey". 
The only thing I knew was to dial up the effort, dial up the effort. The things kept me sane was writing and few video production related works.

One day I edited for 16hours straight, in front of some contest submission deadline. 
Now we had a lot lengthy audio recorded compared to video, and as I continued to try and find audio matching the visuals - I realized something. 
There is a great amount of fun in that process, which I simply ignored because of unconscious blindness, because I was rushing the day of shoot as well.

Few days after that realization, COVID hit the world. 
I got the time to reflect on things I want to change since then, But barely any time to apply those as the pressure increased even when it is supposed to be easier. 
I just needed some more help from me.

I can not say I everything is good now or something like that. But as I wait for my oppurtunity to start the next phase of life- I have three goals. 
1. Give it my all the hours I will be working, no half hearted measures. And yes, I have to race with AI, so I continue to bring more to the table so I remain relavant on the job before I decide to walk into the sunset 20-25 or maybe some more years from now.
2. Value myself more. I have been found guily of not doing that unless that happened naturally
3. Value people around me, value moments more. 

things didnt happen according to me, I would have loved to have a year worth experience by now.

and on the bright side, now I know how linked list works properly.
